### Challenge flagIsRightThere

I opened the console in the dcrypt.in/questions page, and typed in variables related to flag, after a few hit and trials I found a variabl HTMLPass, which was assigned by ``cta.min.js`` JavaScript file also linking the source of the file. Looking for the source on the internet, it was sure that the HTMLPass was a part of the hunt.\
Entering dcrypt{Wkyzu0jDiA} as the flag got a hit.
