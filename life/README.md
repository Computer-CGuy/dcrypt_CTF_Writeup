### Challenge life

The challenge had a Game of Life file as an attachment, importing the file in copy.sh/life/ shows a part of the top of the flag.\
To get an idea of what happened, I exported the file and found that every encoding ends with !\
I replaced the ! character in the pattern file and also removed some unusual characters at the end of file.\
Then opened the modified pattern file, then got the flag.
