### Challenge basicmaths

Disassembling the binary file shows comparison of two numbers 0 and 1, if they are not equal then the binary exits.\
From the disassembled code I found the position of ``0x01`` and edited it to ``0x00`` using a hex editor. The code ran flawlessly and printed out the flag.

Position of 0x01 is ``117F``
